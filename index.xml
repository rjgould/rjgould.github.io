It turns out that over time you can accumulate a lot of unnecessary cruft in the online world the same as you can in the real one.
I decided to start by reversing my age old practice of having registered various domain names with whoever the cheapest registrar was at the time.</description></item><item><title>OK... just static... come back...</title><link>https://www.gould.me.uk/posts/2021/01/2021-01-08-ok-just-static-come-back/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gould.me.uk/posts/2021/01/2021-01-08-ok-just-static-come-back/</guid><description>So recently I found myself in the position where one of the websites I run got wiped from the face of the internet when the hosting provider deleted the VPS that it was running on.
Needless to say this was a somewhat irritating circumstance to find myself in. Whilst I did have recent backups (everyone should these days) this particular site was running on WordPress and as much as I like WordPress the thought of standing everything up from scratch on a new VM was not appealing.</description></item></channel></rss>
